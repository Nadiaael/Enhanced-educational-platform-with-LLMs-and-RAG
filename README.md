# Enhanced educational platform with LLMs and RAG

This project was developed in collaboration with [Salma BELBASBAS](https://github.com/salmabelbasbas).


## Project Overview
This platform was developed to support students in their baccalaureate exam preparation by offering three key features:

1. **Course Scraping and Organization**: We collected and structured baccalaureate courses, making them easily accessible and organized to enhance the revision experience for students.

2. **AI-Powered Chatbot & Quiz Generator**: Using Large Language Models (LLMs) and Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG), we developed an interactive chatbot that provides personalized
answers to studentsâ€™ questions in real-time. Additionally, the platform includes a quiz generator, allowing students to create and take custom quizzes to test their knowledge and track their progress.
3.**Access to all the courses**
